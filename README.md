# Gold Price Prediction using Time Series Analysis

This project focuses on predicting gold prices using time series analysis and various forecasting models. The goal is to develop accurate models for predicting future gold prices based on historical data.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Predict gold prices for better investment decisions.
- **Dataset**: Historical gold price data obtained from [source].
- **Techniques Used**: Time Series Analysis, Linear Regression, Moving Averages, Exponential Smoothing.
- **Tools/Libraries**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Statsmodels.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.
- **`src/`**: Source code for the implemented models and utilities.
- **`results/`**: Folder to store the results and evaluation metrics.
